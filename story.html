      <p class="story-paragraph">
        I spent years in digital product environments where decisions are rarely clean—and leadership shows up when the pressure is real:
        stakeholders misaligned, priorities competing, teams tired, and outcomes still expected.
      </p>

      <p class="story-paragraph">
        Early in my career, I built a foundation in structured problem solving, product thinking, cross-functional alignment and agile delivery.
        Over time that foundation became a framework for helping leaders navigate complexity with clarity and confidence.
      </p>

      <p class="story-paragraph">
        Today I mentor leaders and teams to cut through the noise, make better decisions, and build momentum without burning people out.
        My edge is product thinking applied to leadership: structured, pragmatic, and human–centered.
      </p>

      <p class="story-paragraph">
        I work globally with executives, product organizations and high-stakes teams to foster clarity, strengthen decision cycles, and create sustainable growth patterns.
        It’s not just about what gets shipped — it’s about how people work together to get there.
      </p>

        If you want to align strategy with execution, build decision confidence, and design ways of working that endure — let’s start a conversation.
